# Discrete Probability Distributions

**Is it significantly high or low?**

A result is significantly high if the $P(\text{x or more}) \leq 0.05$.
Similarly, a result is significantluy low if $P(\text{x or fewer}) \leq 0.05$.

And of course you can choose different thresholds.

**`5%` guidleine for cumbersome calculations**

Sampling without replacement results in dependent events, which violate a requirement of a binomial or poisson distributions.
However, if the sample size if less than 5%, most people will treat the selection as being idependent.
